NeuroMorphoVis is an interactive, extensible and cross-platform framework for building, visualizing and analyzing digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology skeletons extracted from microscopy stacks. The framework is capable of detecting and repairing tracing artifacts, allowing the generation of high fidelity surface meshes and high resolution volumetric models for simulation and in silico imaging studies.

The framework is based on Blender 2.78c and is free to download and the python bindings of the HDF5 library. 

The initial release of the software will be available following to the Approval of EPFL. If you wish to get the source code, you can write an email to marwan.abdellah@epfl.ch, CCing felix.schuermann@epfl.ch and henry.makram@epfl.ch, explaining why do you need NeuroMorphoVis. Then we can give you access to the current repository or send you a copy of the source code in a .zip file.
