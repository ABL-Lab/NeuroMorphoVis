# NeuroMorphoVis

NeuroMorphoVis is an interactive, extensible and cross-platform framework for building, visualizing and analyzing digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology skeletons extracted from microscopy stacks. The framework is capable of detecting and repairing tracing artifacts, allowing the generation of high fidelity surface meshes and high resolution volumetric models for simulation and in silico imaging studies.

The framework is based on Blender 2.78c and is free to download and the python bindings of the HDF5 library. 

The initial release of the software will be available by May 2018.
