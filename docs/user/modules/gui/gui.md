# GUI User Guide

## Rationale 
To make it accessible to end users with minimal programming knowledge or even with no programming experience at all, the core functionality of _NeuroMorphoVis_ is exposed to users via a friendly graphical user interface that would allow them to navigate and adjust the parameters of the different toolboxes seamlessly. This page provides a detailed guide to use NeuroMorphoVis from its GUI.

## Landing 
After loading it from the [Add-ons](https://docs.blender.org/manual/fi/dev/preferences/addons.html) manager of Blender, _NeuroMorphoVis_ will appear as a new tab on the left side of Blender. 

When the user clicks on this tab, the following panel will appear. 

This panel the following contains five sectionsor tabs:

+ __Input / Output__ 
+ __Morphology Analysis__
+ __Soma Toolbox__
+ __Morphology Toolbox__
+ __Mesh Toolbox__ 

By default, the _Input / Output_ tab is open while the rest of the tabs are closed. This action is intended to avoid any distraction or negative impressions given to the user. Each tab has already many parameters that can be configured to control certain aspects. Therefore, it is advisable to open __only__ the tab the user is interested in and close the rest of the tabs to avoid any clutter.

Before switching to any other tab, the user must specify in the _Input / Output_ tab the __input morphology__ and the __output directories__ where the different artifacts will be generated. This [guide](input-output.md) explains how to use the _Input / Output_ tab to select a specific morphology either from file by its full path or from a BBP circuit using its GID.

## Using the Toolboxes      
After selecting the input morphology as shown in the previous section, the users can navigate to any of the toolboxes to process the morphology according to their specific purposes.

### Soma Reconstruction
