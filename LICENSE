NeuroMorphoVis

NeuroMorphoVis is an interactive, extensible and cross-platform framework for building, visualizing
and analyzing digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology skeletons extracted from microscopy
stacks.

The framework is capable of detecting and repairing tracing artifacts, allowing the generation of
high fidelity surface meshes and high resolution volumetric models for simulation and in silico
imaging studies.
